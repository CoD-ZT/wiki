# Guidelines for publishing stuff

Some guidelines must be established for publishing stuff here. I propose that all of you add questions and ideas, so we can reach a consensus and build something rational, useful and representative. 

## Questions to be answered
 * What do we want to do?
 * Which are our goals?
 * What do we want to publish?
   * Zines?
   * Source code?
   * Documentation/articles/papers?
 
 * How old published material should be?
 * Which is the criteria to define something as historically relevant?
 * Binaries? Yes or no?
 * How do we organize data?

## Ideas
As proposed in the chat, we could focus on two separate areas:

 * Providing pointers to resources useful for beginners
 * Providing a repository of historically relevant documents and tools, to keep memory of the evolution of the hacker scene

## Proposals
Add your proposals here!
